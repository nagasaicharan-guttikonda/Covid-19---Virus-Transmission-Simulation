# ---- Virus Config ---- #
# Susceptible (S): Susceptible individuals are those who have never been infected with and thus have no immunity against COVID-19. Susceptible individuals become exposed once they are infected with the disease.

# Exposed (E): Those who have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves.

# Infectious (I): Individuals present clinical symptoms and are infectious, and can spread the virus to those they come into close contact with. Usually, they are reported as confirmed cases.

# Removed (R): Removed individuals include deceased patients and recovered ones who are immune to future infection from COVID-19.
